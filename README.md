# VideoSaliency
I'm learning the Video Saliency based on image registrarion. My idea is using lable propagation method to obtain the saliency  result of the first frame. After that, using each frame behind to registrate the saliency result image and get a sequence of saliency results of the frames.Finally, using the sequence we get before to form a new video.
